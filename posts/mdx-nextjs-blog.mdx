I came across MDX some months ago and ever since then I wanted to use it to make a blog (this one). I think when you're a developer, writing is a great way to cement your knowledge because it forces you to organize information, research, break down problems, and understand it enough to be able to explain it in a simple way.

I picked MDX over a CMS because it allows you to embed React components in markdown files - which is quite amazing. However, I found that the initial setup and configuration was a bit of a _nightmare_ because there are a lot of moving parts.

Before jumping into the project, I first wanted to understand how everything fits together. So, as any developer would do, I googled it, watched a few videos, read a few articles and came to the inevitable conclusion that everyone is setting up MDX differently (the beauty of code, am I right?).

Luckily, there are a few open-source blogs like [Adam Laycock](https://github.com/Arcath/arcath.net-next), [Pedro Duarte](https://github.com/peduarte/ped.ro) and [Lee Rob](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) that use MDX with Next.js. So I could poke around their code to try understand what was happening üôè. Then finally, after reading this [article](https://www.arcath.net/2021/03/mdx-bundler) by Adam Laycock, things clicked (almost).

While I'm not 100% confident I completely understand everything yet and there are many things I could build upon (i.e. adding code syntax highlighting, reading time, etc), I'm confident MDX is a great way for developers to write blogs. Here's a bird's-eye view of how _I think_ everything fits together:

1. [Path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path) is used locate the folder where the markdown files are kept and [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) is used to return an array of file paths in that folder.
2. `fs.readFileSync` (a Node method) reads the file path and returns a string containing the content of each file.
3. Then [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) converts [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) (which we use to store post meta data on top of the markdown file) into an object.
4. There are two utility functions: `getAllPostsMeta()` returns the meta (i.e. title, published date, etc) of all posts. `getPostbySlug()` returns the meta and content for a specific post.
5. In the dynamic `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` [page](https://github.com/delbaoliveira/website/blob/main/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D.tsx) , we use `getStaticPaths()` to call `getAllPostsMeta()` and define a list of paths for Next.js to build.
6. In `getStaticProps()` we call `getPostbySlug()` to fetch the content of an specific post and return it as props.
7. Before displaying the post content on the page, [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) takes the markdown string and compiles it into a JSX component using `bundleMDX()` and `getMDXComponent()`
8. Custom styling can be added to compiled JSX elements before they're rendered by creating an object that maps the element names to our own defined components. [See the code here](https://github.com/delbaoliveira/website/blob/main/ui/MdxComponents.tsx).
9. The best way I can describe is we "intercept" the JSX component and inject our own customization by passing it to the component returned by `getMDXComponent()`.

...and that's all for now folks. Time for some tea. ‚òï
