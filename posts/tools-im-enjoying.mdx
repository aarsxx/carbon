I've recently fully returned to the world of web development after a brief hiatus working at Lambda School. _(I'm sorry I left, please take me back)_. As I've got stuck back in, I wanted to share and celebrate the tools that I've had a wonderful experience using.

### Next.js

I'm partial to a bit of React.js, and Next.js has always been a standout framework to me.

I'll use Next's `Link` component to help explain why I enjoy Next itself. As you know, `Link` is a React component that builds on top of the `a` HTML tag. Without significantly changing the way you'd normally use the anchor tag you get the benefits of preloading and client side navigation automatically. And of course, `Link` is still a real Web 1.0&trade; anchor tag in the final output.

Taking the concept further, the Next team recently [released](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10#built-in-image-component-and-automatic-image-optimization) the `<Image>` component. Using an `<Image>` component the same way you'd use an `<img>` tag you get a mobile data friendly, anti jank, image for free. The developer is happy, the browser is happy and the end user is happy. The contract is almost: capitalize a HTML tag and get an enhanced-but-real-html-under-the-hood component for free. Automatic image optimisation is a powerful concept. I wonder what's next? ü•Å

To me, Next.js is to React what `Link` is to `a` and what React is to building UI. Because there is a bridge between my interface and the final output, improvements can be made under the hood, without me, the developer, having to worry about them.

The last thing I want mention goes back to 2019, when I was a wee lass learning to code I remember there was some angst against Next's requirement of a `pages` directory. But this "limitation" seems to have turned out to be an advantage. So much is enabled for so little ceremony **because Next can guarantee a file inside the pages directory is a route**. Some innovations include per page [code splitting](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-react-router#code-splitting), per page choose-your-own-adventure [data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) and [api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

To summarise, I'm enjoying Next because it's an empowering foundation to build my stack on. It gives me, a solo ([for now](/delba-resume.pdf)) developer, access to things previously behind the closed doors of large teams in Series C+ tech startups. It's constantly [evolving](https://nextjs.org/conf) and zealously backwards compatible. While I am building the 100th button, the great team behind Next is improving the framework and pushing the web forward. [People](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/graphs/contributors) [far](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#google-chrome-collaboration) [smarter](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2#growing-the-team) than me are tweaking the engine to get every ounce of performance out of it, and I can redirect all the energy I would have wasted trying to optimize a webpack config into building actual UI. Then you combine Next with Vercel and deploying and hosting is a dream.

### CSS-in-~~JS~~TS

After a year or so (a decade in JS time) of stability in the styling world, there seems to be a renascence, or at least a new take on styling boxes in JavaScript which seems to be primarily enabled by css variables (?). I'm content with Tailwind for now but tools like `stitches` and `vanilla-extract` seem worth a shot, especially for larger design system-y projects. Plus that end-to-end type safety bro!
