# fmt.Println(“hello world”)
Welcome to my new blog!! I’ve decided to move on the minimal website design I had and get something more modern and easy to use.

I’ve been inspiring myself from several websites and people, and I decided to base my new website off leerob’s website that is available on GitHub. I’m slowly going to reupload all the articles in here.

I might want to expand this site a little and post more about myself and cool tech things as well, rather than just keeping it for writeups and guides only.

I hope y’all will stick along and enjoy this redesign as much as I do!
