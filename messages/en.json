        "desc": "My journey into programming started during my undergrad at Bina Nusantara University. Through internships, I gained hands-on experience in iOS development, sparking my passion for creating impactful technology. Now, as a Software Engineer at Epidemic Sound, I focus on implementing algorithms for digital signal processing using Django and Golang.\n\nI specialize in technologies like React, React Native, Django, and Golang, and I'm fluent in Bahasa, English, and proficient in Chinese. Beyond work, I was also recognized at the Apple WWDC Swift Student Challenge. I enjoy sharing my tech discoveries on GitHub and YouTube and unwinding with cooking, movies, and workouts."
