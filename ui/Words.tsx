Delba was instrumental to the program's successful roll out and continued operations. She was always eager to help wherever she could and provided excellent documentation to the rest of the team, ensuring everyone knew exactly what to do. At our weekly planning meetings she would often raise points that the rest of the team had not considered while also providing solutions to the questions of other team members. I have enjoyed working with her immensely, and would jump at the opportunity to do so again in the future.",

This combination of skills - technical and human - made her perfect at her job helping aspiring junior programmers break into software development. The months I spent working with Delba training our African and EU students where some of the most amazing times of my working life. Delba is everywhere at once, knows how to make the most of limited resources and gets the job done. But it's the finesse in her technical work what makes me particularly envious! I hope I'm lucky enough to work with Delba again in the future.",

She was a very dependable person, helping the team fix crucial bugs, pair programming and making the whole team feel great around her. She displayed strong mastery of React and CSS, implemented a chat feature using socket.io and even added emojis. She really showed devotion to the team and the project, and the outcome was an amazing application.",
